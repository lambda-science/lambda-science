### Hello ! 🐍

I'm **Corentin Meyer**. Currently **AI Engineer** at Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, I have a **PhD in biomedical AI.**  
- At ALE, I built from scratch to production an Agentic RAG AI engine named [Pythia 🔮](https://cmeyer.fr/publish/About+Me#Pythia+%F0%9F%94%AE) (generative AI API and Web Application) for company documentation on AWS (1M+ pages of documents, 500+ users).
- During my PhD, I build tools for researchers to analyze multimodal patient data. I built [MyoQuant](https://github.com/lambda-science/MyoQuant)🔬 for muscle histology image with open-data and model ([HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/corentinm7)), [NLMyo](https://github.com/lambda-science/NLMyo)🔧: to explore using LLMs for biopsy text report processing and [IMPatienT](https://github.com/lambda-science/IMPatienT)🗂️ a small web-app to do text annotation and explainable AI prediction.

I also had the opportunity to do bioinformatic and ML teaching at the university. You can find all way to reach me and see my work by accessing **my website: [cmeyer.fr](https://cmeyer.fr)**.
