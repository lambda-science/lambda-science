### Hello ! 🐍
I'm **Corentin Meyer, PhD Student** in bioinformatics and welcome to my GitHub page !

- 👨🏻‍🎓 **PhD Project:** MYO-xIA: Explainable AI for integrated classification and prediction of congenital myopathies.
- 👨‍💻 **Latest Work:** [MyoQuant](https://github.com/lambda-science/MyoQuant)🔬: a tool to quantify pathological features in muscle histology images.
- 📜 **Previous Work:** [IMPatienT](https://github.com/lambda-science/IMPatienT)🗂️: an integrated web application to digitize, process and explore multimodal patient data.
- 🎒 **Currently Learning:** Transformers for computer vision and synthetic data generation using language models and latent diffusion models.
- 🏫 **Teaching:** Bioinformatics at Biotechnology School of Strasbourg (ESBS) and University Of Strasbourg (Unistra). I also created a machine-learning introduction lecture and practicals for students enrolled in the ESBS degree, immunology master degree and data-science for health master degree.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any health-related data-science project. I like translationnal biology and making useful tools tailored to scientist needs.
